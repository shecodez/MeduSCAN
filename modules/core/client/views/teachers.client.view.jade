            | If you do not have an institution join ID and would like one, please send an email to support@meduscan.com

        h4 Step 3
        p Enter the 24 digit institution ID. If the institution that pops up is correct click [yes, request join].
            | Once the Admin views the request he/she will acknowledge your request to join the institution.
            | This process should not take more than a few business days. Your request status can be tracked
            | by going back to the [manage account] link.

        p Once the request status says approved you can add the institution to "My Institutions".
            | Since the web app is in beta test mode a beta tester license will be applied to your institution.
            | Once you've added the institution to your account an admin will change your role to teacher.

        h4 Step 5
        p As a teacher you will be able to access your teacher dashboard via the [teachers] link on the home page
            | where you can create courses, patients, and medications for your students.
